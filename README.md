# Chess AI and Recognition System

This repository combines two exciting projects:  
1. **Chess AI**: A reinforcement learning-based chess engine inspired by AlphaGo Zero methods.  
2. **Chess Recognition**: A system to map chessboard images to structured formats like Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN).

## Chess AI: AlphaGo Zero-Inspired Engine

### Background
This project leverages DeepMind's concepts to train a chess AI capable of mastering the game from scratch. Highlights include:  
- Inspired by **AlphaZero**, which mastered chess in 4 hours and outperformed Stockfish.  
- Uses reinforcement learning with supervised learning for initialization.  

### Features
- Self-play for generating training data.  
- Supervised learning for faster convergence.  
- Distributed training for scalable model development.  
- Outputs a Universal Chess Interface (UCI) compatible engine.  

### Installation
1. **Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the workers:
Self-Play:
bash
Copier le code
python src/chess_zero/run.py self
Trainer:
bash
Copier le code
python src/chess_zero/run.py opt
Evaluator:
bash
Copier le code
python src/chess_zero/run.py eval
Refer to the AlphaGo Zero Implementation for additional details.

Chess Recognition: Image-to-FEN Mapping
Background
The Chess Recognition system converts chessboard images into structured FEN strings that can be used by chess engines. This involves:

Board Localization: Detecting the chessboard's corners and squares.
Occupancy Classification: Identifying empty/occupied squares.
Piece Classification: Recognizing specific pieces on the board.
FEN String Generation: Producing the FEN representation of the position.
Features
Trained on a synthetic dataset of ~5,000 chess images at varying angles and lighting.
Modular pipeline for image processing and FEN generation.
REST API integration for real-world applications.
Installation

Create the dataset:
bash
Copier le code
python -m chesscog.transfer_learning.create_dataset
Train the model:
bash
Copier le code
python -m chesscog.transfer_learning.train_model
Combined Vision
